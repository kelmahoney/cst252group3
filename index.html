							<h6>Impact:</h6>
							<h7>
							The biggest impact that has been observed when it comes to plastic ocean pollution is the detrimental effect it has had on marine life. An estimated 14 million tons of plastic is being cycled through our oceans every year with that number increasing every day. This has a direct impact on the livelihood of marine species. Marine life can easily be suffocated, ingest debris and starve resulting in several deaths. On an even larger scale plastic pollution can have a severe impact on climate change. When plastic is incinerated the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is typically above the legal limit. To help lessen our own impact on the marine environment there are several measures we are able to take to help. Efforts to adhere to guidelines and legislation should be increased as well as reviewing any outdated measures. When visiting beaches and parks it is important to pack up any trash or debris you may have created while visiting. Additionally picking up other debris that can easily be washed out to sea helps prevent dangerous chemicals and trash from harming marine life. These efforts can easily be followed by all and can greatly generate a positive outcome for the future.
							</h7>
							<h6>Process:</h6>
							<h7>
							The Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 prohibited dumping trash into the ocean. Every year there are 8 million tons added to the already 150 million metric tons of plastic in the ocean. Only 9% gets recycled. Plastic is not biodegradable and cannot decompose. Microscopic pieces of plastic are being found inside marine life and ending up in our foods. Because of the sun, ocean current, marine life, and temperature changes plastic can break down and become micro pieces of plastic floating in the ocean. Because some larger pieces of plastic in the ocean are more buoyant they end up in a swarm of plastic in the current that circulates in our oceans. Marine life doesn’t know that they are constantly consuming plastic whether it’s microscopic or large enough to think that it’s food. Because of this it also affects human life as well and can be consumed as well. Whether you live near the ocean or not your plastic can still end up there.
							</h7>
							<h6>Realization:</h6>
							<h7>
							Even when people recycle, only a small portion of the plastic is recycled and the rest of it ends up in the environment. Because of this, people need to focus more on sustainability solutions than recycling. This will lessen the plastic that just ends up in the environment. The waste of plastic does not only affect the environment but also humans, as the fossil fuel-derived plastic can cause health issues in humans, both adults and children. However, plastic pollution mainly targets megafauna. It is not only the single use plastic that is causing harm but the micro-particles from the plastic. These can get into organisms and it can affect animals and humans higher up in the food chain. The higher in the food chain, the more harmful the micro-particles become. The primary producers are not as affected as the top predator. At least ten percent of plastic ends up in the ocean.
							</h7>
							<h6>Solutions:</h6>
							<h7>
							There have by and large been two approaches to solving this solution. The first is the development of technologies and strategies that prevent plastics from ending up in waterways. The second is the creation and implementation of technologies that remove marine and river pollution.
							The most well-known and successful effort to clean the ocean is The Ocean Cleanup, which has made efforts to clean up plastic from the ocean with their Project 001. Additionally they have worked towards intercepting plastics in rivers and other sources of water before they reach the ocean. This is done through The Interceptor, a small watercraft that is solar powered and placed in rivers to collect trash before it reaches the ocean.
							Beach cleanups are also a large part of the process of cleaning the ocean as beaches often become polluted and it is useful to remove garbage that has been washed up before it degrades further and is washed back into the sea.
							In terms of preventing plastics from ending up in the ocean there is also much to be done on an individual level, such as making sure to dispose of plastics correctly by recycling them. That said, much of the issue lies with countries that do not have systems in place to facilitate the proper disposal of plastics, as well as the fact that too much plastic is being used.
